            <p>Hey! Thanks for checking out this page!</p>

            <p>My name is Adelina and I am starting my career in programming.
               My journey up to this point was very diverse. I tried mechanical engineering, architecture and even
               design until I found my real passion. Now I am 26 and this fall I am starting to study computer science 
               (third timeâ€™s the charm!) I currently work two jobs in order to support myself, so I created this
               donation page hoping that someone might find my story interesting and help me along the way.</p>
